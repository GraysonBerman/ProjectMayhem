Multiplayer GUI Game



The code for the GUI has to be opened in a program called INTELLIJ. It compiles in the IDE, but we're having issues getting it to compile in terminal.

The code for the rest needs to be downloaded, compiled in terminal using javac filename, and then use java filename to run the program.
